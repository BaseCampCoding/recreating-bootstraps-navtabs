# Recreating Bootstrap Nav Tabs

Your assignment is write the CSS and JavaScript required to mimic
a minimal example of Bootstrap's Nav Tabs.

Links to Bootstrap's CSS/JS are included in `index.html` so you can
see how the page should look.

Comment out the Bootstrap links and add the necessary CSS/JS to
`navtabs.css` and `navtabs.js` to get to work :smile:.

# Requirements

-   The active tab is appropriately maintained:
    -   There should only be 1 active tab at a time
    -   It should be styled like Bootstrap styles it
-   The active tab content is appropriately maintained:
    -   There should only be 1 visible tab content at a time
    -   It should be the tab content associated with the
        currently active tab
